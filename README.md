PhaseLatch – 6502-Interfaced High-Speed ADC for Experimental SDR

Blog post & video: https://abnielsen.com/2025/12/24/6502-and-a-20mhz-adc-takes-up-the-challenge/

PhaseLatch is an open-source hardware project that explores how far a classic MOS 6502-class CPU can be pushed into modern signal-processing territory. The board implements a dual-channel, 10-bit, 20 MSPS analog-to-digital converter with a straight binary parallel output, allowing the ADC to be memory-mapped directly onto a 6502 (8 bit) data bus.

Unlike typical SDR designs that rely on high-performance microcontrollers or FPGAs, PhaseLatch intentionally interfaces high-speed conversion hardware with a severely resource-constrained 8-bit CPU. This makes it a platform for experimenting with timing limits, bus contention, memory expansion, and minimalist DSP techniques such as Goertzel tone detection executed entirely on the 6502.

The board is designed as a modular Arduino-shield-style form factor and is intended to stack with the PhaseLoom IQ mixer and the 65uino 6502 system. Direct access to the CPU address, data, and control signals enables single-instruction ADC reads and deterministic sampling under software control.

PhaseLatch is not intended to achieve full theoretical ADC bandwidth on a 6502. Instead, it serves as a practical exploration of real-world limitations, architectural trade-offs, and creative signal-processing approaches on vintage computing hardware.

Though noone says it can't be used with a more powerful platform.. But.. Spoilers :)

## Purchase

Interested in owning a PhaseLatch?  
[Buy one here](https://www.imania.dk/index.php?cPath=204&sort=5a&language=en).

## How to Use
[6502 source code still lives over on the 65uino project](https://github.com/AndersBNielsen/65uino/)

The main 65uino firmware currently comes with support for the PhaseLatch built in. Time of writing, use the SDR branch. 

## Getting a PCB

## Production & Manufacturing
- The `jlcpcb/gerber/` folder contains all necessary files for PCB fabrication.
- The `production_files/` folder includes:
